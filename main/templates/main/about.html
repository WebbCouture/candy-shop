      A Sweet Family Tradition
    </h2>

    <p class="about-text">
      Our story began in 1952, when Grandma Elsie started making caramel fudge in her tiny kitchen using just a wooden spoon and an old family recipe. Word spread quickly, and soon neighbors were lining up for a taste of her rich, buttery treats.
    </p>

    <p class="about-text">
      In 1985, her son Thomas opened our first candy shop on Main Street. From sour gummies to chocolate bark, each piece was handmade with love and joy—just like Elsie taught him.

    <p class="about-text">
      Today, three generations later, we’re still crafting candy with care, mixing timeless tradition with new flavors. Thank you for being part of our sweet story!
