<h1>Candy Shop Blog</h1>
<p>Welcome to the Candy Shop Blog — your go-to place for all things sweet! Whether you’re a lifelong candy lover or just looking for a little sugar-spiration, you’ll find plenty of tasty reads here.</p>

<h2>🍭 Behind the Scenes</h2>
<p>Ever wondered how we make our famous rainbow lollipops? It’s a mix of art, science, and a lot of love! We carefully heat premium sugar, add natural fruit flavors, and hand-pour each lollipop into custom molds. No two lollies are exactly alike — which means every piece is unique, just like you!</p>

<h2>🍫 Chocolate Corner</h2>
<p>From rich Belgian truffles to creamy milk chocolate bars, our selection is crafted with only the finest cocoa beans. We believe chocolate should be an experience — one that starts with a heavenly aroma and ends with a melt-in-your-mouth moment you won’t forget.</p>

<h2>🍬 Seasonal Treats</h2>
<p>We love celebrating the seasons! In spring, you’ll find pastel-colored marshmallow chicks. In summer, it’s all about sour gummies shaped like tropical fruits. Fall brings our famous pumpkin spice caramels, and winter wouldn’t be complete without our peppermint bark.</p>

<h2>🎉 Candy Tips & Tricks</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Store chocolate in a cool, dry place — never in the fridge, unless it’s extremely hot!</li>
    <li>Gummies last longer in airtight containers.</li>
    <li>To keep hard candy shiny, avoid humid environments.</li>
</ul>

<h2>📅 Upcoming Events</h2>
<p>Mark your calendars! We’ll be at the Annual Sweet Fest downtown next month, offering free samples and fun candy-making demos. Stop by and say hi!</p>
